I started playing bass guitar again this year, after an absensce of over a decade. As a result, I've been seeking out music to play along to, deliberately choosing music that was new to me, and had a distinctive, and interesting bass sound.

All that is to say that I've listened to some music this year that was totally new to me. Some of it _actually_ new, but most of it just albums or artists that had previously passed me by.

As the year comes to an end, I'm using this post to gather some of the best albums of 2024, through lists created by others. I'll update this over the course of the next month or so, I'd imagine.

First one I noticed is [Memorial Device's list of the top 20 best albums of 2024. In Order](https://bsky.app/profile/memorialdevice.bsky.social/post/3lbyquioyc22p). As I write this, the list has reachd number 11 and I have only heard of 4 of the artists. Such is the way with Memorial Device's taste in music. They are much cooler than I am.
