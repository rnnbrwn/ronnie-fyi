I post to here so infrequently that I've forgotten how to do it. This is essentially a test of the system. In case it works, I might as well write something:

In some downtime over the festive period - I haven't had much, as you can imagine - I've been playing around with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) and (separately), dipping into some [WordPress theme development](https://developer.wordpress.org/) for the first time in ages. More of the same this year, is the plan.

I've been asked to build a couple of sites and I'm trying to figure out which is the best for all parties. That is, what's easiest to update for the client, and for me to build. Right now, that's probably WordPress but I'll see how I get on.
