One hundred years ago, I built my first personal website and started blogging. I'm not sure why, but I kinda fell away from it all and focused more on work, than on personal sites and projects.

But I'm back, with lots of stuff lined up - more on that in another post.

I bought this domain a while back and it's been sitting in cold storage ever since. I'll go into a bit more detail in another post but, over the last year, I've been far more involved in *hands-on* web development, than I had been for the previous several years. I've even built some sites.

- [Mostly Consulting](https://mostly.consulting)
- [Hay Facilities](https://www.hayfacilities.co.uk)
- [Sam & Laura](https://samandlaura.wedding)
- [Hotel Westminster](https://www.hotelwestminster.co.uk)

On top of that, I've started drawing a bit more, too. All of which brings me back to this site. I'm not 100% sure what it'll contain, but I've got a lot of stuff I want to put online, and I don't want to be handing over content to Facebook, Insta, Twitter etc. I've finally come to the conclusion that it's better to host it myself. So here we are.
