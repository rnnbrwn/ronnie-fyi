I've been away for a bit. Sorry about that. In the meantime, here's some site branding I've been working on. Any thoughts, send them to me on Twitter [@rnnbrwn](https://twitter.com/rnnbrwn)

I played around with some pinks and yellows before settling on a blue that I liked for a full colour variant. Below that are a more minimal light-on-dark and and dark-on-light variant.

Next thing to do is to start building out v1 of this site, with colours and branding. Future Ronnie says he'll do that.
