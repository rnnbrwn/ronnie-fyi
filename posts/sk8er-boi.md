While I was away, it was my daughter's 9th birthday. In the run up to the big day, she made it clear that she wanted a skateboard but - and I didn't need much convincing - I had to get one, too. She's obviously heard about my amazing skating skills.

For some reason, she has it in her head that I can teach her. Well, a few YouTube videos later (mainly, [Braille Skateboarding's Learn to Skateboard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34F060CE1BA3E968) videos) I think I can at least show her how to ride it.

I skated a bit as a teenager, but nothing more than being relatively comfortable on the board, and being able to do a passable ollie. But now I'm a 45-year-old sk8er boi and I'm here for it.

Here's what I bought myself.

I've already swapped out the bearings and replaced the wheels with something a bit bigger and softer to deal with the crappy pavements around my way.

I'll be sure to let you know when I make my first trip to casualty with a broken collar bone.

In the meantime, here's some Avril Lavigne.
